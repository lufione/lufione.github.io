Once a YouTuber has joined the program and has accumulated at least 1,000 subscribers and 4,000 watch hours in the past 12 months, they can start running ads on their videos. YouTube takes a percentage of the revenue generated from these ads and pays the rest to the YouTuber.</p><h2>How Do YouTubers Make Money From Subscribers?</h2><p>There are several ways that YouTubers can make money from their subscribers. One of the most common ways is through YouTube’s Super Chat and Super Stickers features. These features allow viewers to donate money to their favorite YouTubers during live streams. YouTubers can also earn money through sponsorships, merchandise sales, and fan funding.</p><h3>Super Chat and Super Stickers</h3><p>Super Chat and Super Stickers are features that allow viewers to donate money to their favorite YouTubers during live streams.

Companies will pay YouTubers to promote their products or services in their videos. The amount of money that YouTubers can earn from sponsorships varies depending on the company and the size of their audience.</p><h3>Merchandise Sales</h3><p>YouTubers can also earn money from selling merchandise to their subscribers. This can include anything from t-shirts to phone cases to coffee mugs. The amount of money that YouTubers can earn from merchandise sales varies depending on the type of merchandise and the size of their audience.</p><h3>Fan Funding</h3><p>Fan funding is another way that YouTubers can earn money from their subscribers. This feature allows viewers to donate money to their favorite YouTubers through a crowdfunding platform. YouTubers can set up campaigns for specific projects, such as creating a new video series or buying new equipment.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>Getting paid by subscribers is a great way for YouTubers to earn money and make a living doing what they love. While YouTube’s Partner Program is the most common way that YouTubers earn money from their subscribers, there are also several other ways that they can monetize their content. By building a loyal and engaged audience, YouTubers can earn a significant amount of money through sponsorships, merchandise sales, fan funding, and more.</p><h2>FAQ</h2><h3>How much money do YouTubers make from subscribers?</h3><p>The amount of money that YouTubers make from subscribers varies depending on the size of their audience and the ways in which they monetize their content. Some YouTubers can earn thousands of dollars per month from their subscribers, while others may only earn a few hundred dollars.</p><h3>How do I become a YouTube partner?</h3><p>To become a YouTube partner, you need to have at least 1,000 subscribers and 4,000 watch hours in the past 12 months.
