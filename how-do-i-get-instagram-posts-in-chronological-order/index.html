One of the changes that many users have been unhappy about is the algorithmic feed. This means that Instagram doesn't show posts in chronological order. Instead, it decides which posts to show you based on your usage patterns and engagement. This can make it difficult to keep up with the accounts you follow. In this article, we will show you how to get Instagram posts in chronological order in 2023.</p><h2>Why Instagram Changed to an Algorithmic Feed</h2><p>Instagram changed to an algorithmic feed to improve user engagement. The idea was that by showing users the most relevant posts, they would spend more time on the app. This, in turn, would increase ad revenue for Instagram. However, many users have been unhappy with the change as they feel like they are missing out on posts from their favorite accounts.</p><h2>How to Get Instagram Posts in Chronological Order</h2><h3>Step 1: Turn on Notifications</h3><p>One way to get Instagram posts in chronological order is to turn on notifications for the accounts you follow.

Then select "Turn on Post Notifications."</p><h3>Step 2: Use Third-Party Apps</h3><p>Another way to get Instagram posts in chronological order is to use third-party apps. These apps allow you to view your feed in chronological order. Some popular options include Hootsuite, Later, and Planoly. However, keep in mind that using third-party apps can be risky as it goes against Instagram's terms of service.</p><h3>Step 3: Create a List</h3><p>You can also create a list of accounts that you want to see posts from in chronological order. This way, you can quickly access their posts without having to scroll through your entire feed. To create a list, go to your profile and tap the three lines in the top right corner. Then select "Lists" and "Create List."</p><h2>FAQ</h2><h3>Can I Change Back to Chronological Order on Instagram?</h3><p>No, Instagram does not allow users to change back to chronological order.
