Quora</u></center></a></figcaption></figure><h2>Introduction</h2> TikTok has taken the world by storm since its launch in 2016. With over a billion active users, it has become a platform for content creators to showcase their talent and earn money. But how much money can you make per 1000 views on TikTok? In this article, we will explore the different ways in which you can make money on TikTok and how much you can expect to earn. <h2>TikTok Creator Fund</h2> TikTok has recently launched its Creator Fund, which allows creators to earn money based on their views. The fund is currently available in the US, UK, and other select countries. To apply for the Creator Fund, you need to have at least 100,000 followers, be 18 years or older, and have a certain number of views in the last 30 days. Once you are accepted into the Creator Fund, you will earn money based on your views. The exact amount you earn per 1000 views is not disclosed by TikTok, but creators have reported earning anywhere from $0.01 to $0.02 per view. This means that if you have 100,000 views on your video, you can earn anywhere from $10 to $20. <h2>Brand Partnerships</h2> Another way to earn money on TikTok is through brand partnerships. If you have a large following on TikTok, brands may approach you to promote their products or services. The amount you can earn from brand partnerships varies depending on the brand and the type of content you create. Some brands may pay you a flat fee for a single post, while others may pay you based on the number of views or engagement your post receives. The amount you can earn per 1000 views through brand partnerships can range anywhere from $20 to $200 or more. <h2>Affiliate Marketing</h2> Affiliate marketing is another way to make money on TikTok. With affiliate marketing, you promote a product or service and earn a commission on any sales made through your unique affiliate link. You can promote products related to your niche or audience, and the amount you can earn per 1000 views depends on the commission rate and the product's price. For example, if you promote a product with a 10% commission rate and a price of $50, you can earn $5 for every sale made through your link. If you have 1000 views on your video and 10% of your viewers make a purchase, you can earn $50 or more per 1000 views. <h2>Donations and Fan Support</h2> TikTok also has a feature called Live Gifts, which allows viewers to send virtual gifts to their favorite creators during live streams. Creators can then convert these gifts into real money. The amount you can earn per 1000 views through Live Gifts depends on the number of gifts you receive and their value. In addition to Live Gifts, some creators also offer fan support through platforms like Patreon or Ko-fi. These platforms allow fans to support their favorite creators by making monthly or one-time donations. The amount you can earn per 1000 views through fan support varies depending on the number of supporters and the amount they donate. <h2>Conclusion</h2> In conclusion, the amount you can earn per 1000 views on TikTok depends on the different monetization methods you use. The TikTok Creator Fund, brand partnerships, affiliate marketing, and donations and fan support are all viable options for earning money on TikTok. While the exact amount you can earn per 1000 views may vary, with dedication and hard work, you can turn your TikTok account into a source of income. </article>
