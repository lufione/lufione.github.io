The game is set in a dystopian future where players take on the role of a mercenary named V, who is on a mission to make a name for themselves in Night City. One of the main objectives of the game is to earn cash, which is used to buy weapons, upgrades, and other items that help players progress through the game. In this article, we will provide you with tips on how to earn cash in Cyberpunk 2077.</p><h2>Sell Items</h2><p>One of the easiest ways to earn cash in Cyberpunk 2077 is to sell items that you no longer need. You can sell weapons, clothes, and other items that you have collected throughout the game. To sell items, you need to visit a vendor or a shop. You can find vendors in various locations throughout Night City. When selling items, it's important to keep in mind that different vendors offer different prices, so it's worth shopping around to get the best deal.</p><h2>Complete Side Quests</h2><p>Another way to earn cash in Cyberpunk 2077 is to complete side quests. Side quests are missions that are not part of the main story but offer rewards when completed. Completing side quests can earn you cash, as well as weapons, upgrades, and other useful items. Side quests can be found by talking to NPCs or by exploring the city. Some side quests can be challenging, so it's a good idea to level up your character before attempting them.</p><h2>Hack and Steal</h2><p>Hacking and stealing are two activities that can earn you cash in Cyberpunk 2077. You can hack into ATMs, vending machines, and other electronic devices to get cash. You can also steal items from NPCs or from shops. When stealing, it's important to avoid getting caught by the police or security guards. If you do get caught, you may have to pay a fine or face other consequences.</p><h2>Invest in Stocks</h2><p>If you're looking for a more passive way to earn cash in Cyberpunk 2077, you can invest in stocks. There are several companies in Night City that you can invest in, each with its own risks and rewards. Investing in stocks can be a good way to earn cash over time, but it's important to keep an eye on the market and sell your stocks at the right time to maximize your profits.</p><h2>Join a Gang</h2><p>Joining a gang can be a lucrative way to earn cash in Cyberpunk 2077. Gangs control various parts of Night City and offer missions to their members. These missions can earn you cash, as well as weapons and other useful items. Joining a gang can also provide you with protection, but it's important to be aware of the risks involved.</p><h2>Upgrade Your Cyberware</h2><p>Upgrading your cyberware is another way to earn cash in Cyberpunk 2077. Cyberware is technology that can be implanted into your body to enhance your abilities. Upgrading your cyberware can be expensive, but it can also provide you with new abilities that can help you complete missions more efficiently. Some cyberware upgrades can also increase your earning potential by allowing you to hack into more advanced electronic devices.</p><h2>Participate in Fights</h2><p>Participating in fights can be another way to earn cash in Cyberpunk 2077. There are several fight clubs throughout Night City that offer cash prizes to winners. These fights can be challenging, so it's important to level up your character and improve your combat skills before participating.</p><h2>Sell Drugs</h2><p>Selling drugs is another activity that can earn you cash in Cyberpunk 2077. You can buy drugs from vendors or find them in various locations throughout Night City. Selling drugs can be risky, as it can attract the attention of the police or rival gangs. It's important to be careful when selling drugs and to avoid getting caught.</p><h2>Complete Main Missions</h2><p>Completing main missions is the primary way to progress through the story of Cyberpunk 2077. Main missions can also earn you cash, as well as weapons, upgrades, and other useful items. It's important to complete main missions in a timely manner to avoid missing out on rewards.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>There are many ways to earn cash in Cyberpunk 2077, each with its own risks and rewards. Whether you prefer to sell items, complete side quests, or join a gang, there are plenty of opportunities to earn cash and progress through the game. It's important to keep in mind that some activities, such as hacking and stealing, can have consequences, so it's important to be careful and avoid getting caught. With these tips in mind, you'll be well on your way to earning cash and making a name for yourself in Night City.</p></article>
