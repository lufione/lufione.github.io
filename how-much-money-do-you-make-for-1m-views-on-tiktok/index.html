One popular method is through brand partnerships. If you have a large following and create engaging content, brands may be interested in partnering with you to promote their products or services.

You should also interact with your followers and respond to comments to build a loyal fanbase. Finally, use hashtags and participate in challenges to increase your visibility on the platform.</p><h2>FAQs</h2><h3>How often does TikTok pay creators?</h3><p>TikTok pays creators on a monthly basis, typically around the 21st of each month.</p><h3>Do I need a certain number of followers to monetize my TikTok account?</h3><p>Yes, in order to be eligible for the Creator Fund, you must have at least 100,000 followers.</p><h3>Can I monetize my TikTok account if I'm under 18?</h3><p>No, in order to participate in the Creator Fund, you must be over 18 years old.</p><h3>Can I make money on TikTok without using the Creator Fund?</h3><p>Yes, you can make money on TikTok through brand partnerships, live streaming, and other methods.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>There are several ways to make money on TikTok, including through the Creator Fund, brand partnerships, and live streaming.
