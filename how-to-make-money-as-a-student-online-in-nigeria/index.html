This is a great way to make money while also improving your teaching skills.</p><h2>Online Surveys</h2><p>You can also make money by taking online surveys. Companies are always looking for feedback on their products and services, and they are willing to pay for it. Websites like Swagbucks, Survey Junkie, and Vindale Research offer paid surveys to users in Nigeria.</p><h2>Affiliate Marketing</h2><p>Affiliate marketing is a way to earn a commission by promoting other people's products.
