The game is free to play, but like most mobile games, it offers in-app purchases that can help players progress faster. If you're looking to get more money on SimCity BuildIt without spending real money, then you're in luck. In this article, we'll be sharing tips and tricks to help you earn more simoleons and grow your city.</p><h2>1. Invest in Your City</h2><p>The first step to earning more money in SimCity BuildIt is to invest in your city. This means building more residential, commercial, and industrial zones. The more zones you have, the more taxes you can collect from your citizens. It's important to balance your zones to ensure that your city is functioning properly. A good rule of thumb is to have a 2:1 ratio of residential to commercial zones.</p><h2>2. Keep Your Citizens Happy</h2><p>Happy citizens are more likely to pay taxes and stay in your city. To keep your citizens happy, you need to provide them with basic services such as water, power, and sewage. You also need to build parks, schools, and hospitals to improve their quality of life. Don't forget to also manage traffic, crime, and pollution to keep your citizens happy.</p><h2>3. Sell Your Excess Items</h2><p>If you find yourself with excess items such as building materials, don't let them go to waste. Sell them to other players using the trade depot. You can also sell items such as furniture and electronics in your commercial zones. The more items you sell, the more simoleons you can earn.</p><h2>4. Participate in Contests</h2><p>SimCity BuildIt offers regular contests that reward players with prizes such as simoleons, building materials, and special items. Participate in these contests to earn more rewards and improve your city. You can also join a club to participate in club contests and earn even more rewards.</p><h2>5. Complete Achievements</h2><p>Completing achievements can also earn you simoleons and other rewards. Achievements range from building a certain number of buildings to collecting a certain number of items. Keep an eye out for new achievements and work towards completing them to earn more rewards.</p><h2>6. Watch Ads</h2><p>SimCity BuildIt offers players the option to watch ads to earn simoleons and other rewards. Take advantage of this feature to earn extra cash. You can also watch ads to speed up production times and get more building materials.</p><h2>7. Connect with Facebook</h2><p>Connecting your SimCity BuildIt account with Facebook can also earn you rewards. You can earn simoleons and other rewards by inviting friends to play or by visiting their cities. You can also join Facebook groups to connect with other players and earn more rewards.</p><h2>8. Use Cheats</h2><p>While using cheats is not recommended, some players choose to use them to earn more simoleons. There are various cheats available online, but be careful as using cheats can get your account banned. It's always better to play the game fairly and earn simoleons through honest means.</p><h2>9. Upgrade Your Buildings</h2><p>Upgrading your buildings can also help you earn more money. Upgraded buildings produce more goods and services, which can be sold for more simoleons. It's important to balance your upgrading with your other expenses to ensure that your city is functioning properly.</p><h2>10. Patience is Key</h2><p>Finally, remember that patience is key when playing SimCity BuildIt. Building a successful city takes time and effort. Don't rush to expand too quickly as this can lead to problems down the line. Take your time and enjoy the process of building your city.</p></article>
