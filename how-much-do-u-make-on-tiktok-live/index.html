However, creators can earn money through live streaming by receiving gifts from their viewers.</p><p>Gifts are virtual items that viewers can purchase using real money and send to their favorite creators during live streams. The gifts have different values, and creators earn a percentage of the value of the gifts they receive.</p><p>The percentage of the gift value that creators earn depends on their level. TikTok has five levels for its creators, and the higher the level, the higher the percentage of the gift value earned. The levels are determined by the creator's engagement, content quality, and consistency.</p><h2>How to Increase Your Earnings from TikTok Live?</h2><p>If you want to earn more from TikTok Live, you need to focus on increasing your engagement, content quality, and consistency.

You need to have a large following, high engagement, and great content to attract gifts from your viewers.</p><h3>2. How much do TikTok stars make per live stream?</h3><p>There is no fixed amount that TikTok stars make per live stream, as it depends on the number and value of gifts they receive.
