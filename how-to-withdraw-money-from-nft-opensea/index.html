If you've sold an NFT on OpenSea, you may be wondering how to withdraw your earnings. In this article, we'll walk you through the steps to withdraw your money from OpenSea.</p><h2>Step 1: Connect Your Wallet</h2><p>To withdraw your earnings from OpenSea, you'll need to connect your wallet to the platform. OpenSea supports a variety of wallets, including MetaMask, WalletConnect, and Coinbase Wallet. Once you've connected your wallet, you'll be able to see your earnings on the "My Account" page.</p><h2>Step 2: Request a Payout</h2><p>Once you've connected your wallet, you can request a payout from OpenSea. To do this, go to the "My Account" page and click on the "Withdraw" button. You'll be prompted to enter the amount you want to withdraw and your wallet address. Make sure to double-check your wallet address to ensure that your earnings are sent to the correct place.</p><h2>Step 3: Wait for Confirmation</h2><p>After you've requested a payout, OpenSea will review your request and send you an email confirmation. This process can take up to 24 hours, so be patient. Once your request has been approved, your earnings will be sent to your wallet address. You can then withdraw your money to your bank account or use it to buy other cryptocurrencies.</p><h2>FAQs</h2><h3>How long does it take to receive my earnings?</h3><p>It can take up to 24 hours for OpenSea to review your payout request and send you a confirmation. Once your request has been approved, your earnings will be sent to your wallet address, which can take a few minutes to a few hours depending on the blockchain network congestion.</p><h3>What fees does OpenSea charge for withdrawals?</h3><p>OpenSea charges a 2.5% fee for withdrawals, which is deducted from your earnings.

Make sure to double-check your wallet address before submitting your payout request.</p><h2>Tips and Tricks</h2><p>If you're planning to sell NFTs on OpenSea, make sure to do your research on the current market trends and prices. You can also promote your NFTs on social media to increase visibility and attract potential buyers.</p><p>Additionally, consider investing in a hardware wallet to store your earnings securely.
