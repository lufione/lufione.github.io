With businesses closing down and people losing their jobs, it's becoming more difficult to make ends meet. However, there are several ways to get emergency money during COVID-19. In this article, we'll discuss some of the options available to you.</p><h2>1. Apply for Unemployment Benefits</h2><p>If you've lost your job due to COVID-19, you may be eligible for unemployment benefits. Each state has its own requirements, so it's important to check with your state's unemployment office to see if you qualify. You can apply online or by phone, and the process usually takes a few weeks.</p><h2>2. Seek Financial Assistance from Charities</h2><p>Many charities are offering financial assistance to people affected by COVID-19. Some of these charities include The Salvation Army, The United Way, and Feeding America. You can visit their websites to see if you qualify for assistance.</p><h2>3. Consider Freelancing</h2><p>If you're good at writing, graphic design, or programming, you can consider freelancing. There are several websites like Upwork, Freelancer, and Fiverr that offer freelance opportunities. You can create a profile and start bidding for jobs.</p><h2>4. Apply for a Personal Loan</h2><p>If you have good credit, you can apply for a personal loan. Many banks and credit unions are offering loans with low-interest rates during COVID-19. However, it's important to read the terms and conditions carefully before applying.</p><h2>5. Sell Unwanted Items</h2><p>You can sell unwanted items like clothes, electronics, and furniture to make some extra cash. There are several websites like eBay, Craigslist, and Facebook Marketplace where you can sell your items online.</p><h2>6. Participate in Paid Surveys</h2><p>Many companies are offering paid surveys to get feedback on their products and services. You can participate in these surveys and get paid for your opinions. Some of the popular survey websites include Swagbucks, Survey Junkie, and Vindale Research.</p><h2>7. Rent Out Your Space</h2><p>If you have a spare room or a parking space, you can rent it out to make some extra money. There are several websites like Airbnb, VRBO, and HomeAway where you can list your space for rent.</p><h2>8. Apply for a Credit Card</h2><p>If you have good credit, you can apply for a credit card with a 0% introductory APR. This will allow you to make purchases without paying any interest for a certain period of time. However, it's important to make sure that you can pay off the balance before the introductory period ends.</p><h2>9. Borrow from Family and Friends</h2><p>If you have family or friends who are willing to help, you can borrow money from them. However, it's important to have a repayment plan in place and to stick to it.</p><h2>10. Seek Help from Government Programs</h2><p>The government has several programs to help people affected by COVID-19. Some of these programs include the CARES Act, the Paycheck Protection Program, and the Economic Injury Disaster Loan Program. You can visit the government's website to see if you qualify for assistance.</p></div></body></html></article>
