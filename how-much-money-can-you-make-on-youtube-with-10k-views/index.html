It was created in 2005 and has since become one of the most popular websites in the world. YouTube is owned by Google and is used by millions of people every day.</p><h2>How Do You Make Money on YouTube?</h2><p>There are several ways to make money on YouTube. The most common way is through advertising revenue. YouTube pays content creators a percentage of the revenue generated from the ads that appear on their videos. The amount of money you can make from advertising revenue depends on several factors, including the number of views your videos get, the type of ads that appear on your videos, and the demographics of your audience.</p><h2>How Much Money Can You Make on YouTube with 10k Views in 2023?</h2><p>The amount of money you can make on YouTube with 10k views in 2023 depends on several factors.
