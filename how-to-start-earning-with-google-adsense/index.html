Once your site is approved, you can start displaying ads.</p><p>To sign up for AdSense, go to the Google AdSense website and fill out the application. You'll need to provide some basic information about your website and yourself. Once you're approved, you'll receive a code to add to your website.</p><h2>How Do I Display Ads?</h2><p>To display ads on your website, you'll need to add the AdSense code to your site. This code will generate the ads and display them on your site. The ads will be relevant to the content on your site, which means they're more likely to be clicked on by visitors.</p><p>You can choose where the ads are displayed on your site, such as in the sidebar, header, or footer. You can also choose the size and type of ads that are displayed. Google provides a variety of ad formats, including text, display, and video ads.</p><h2>How Much Money Can I Make with AdSense?</h2><p>The amount of money you can make with AdSense depends on several factors, such as the number of visitors to your site, the type of ads displayed, and the cost per click of the ads. Generally, the more traffic your site gets, the more money you can make. However, it's important to note that AdSense is not a get-rich-quick scheme. It takes time and effort to build up your traffic and earn a significant amount of money.</p><h2>How Do I Optimize My Ads?</h2><p>To maximize your earnings with AdSense, it's important to optimize your ads. This means choosing the right ad formats, sizes, and placements. You should also experiment with different ad types and colors to see what works best for your site.

You can choose to receive payment via check, direct deposit, or wire transfer. It's important to keep track of your earnings and payments so you can make sure you're getting paid correctly.</p><h2>What Are Some Common Mistakes to Avoid?</h2><p>There are several common mistakes that AdSense publishers make that can hurt their earnings. One mistake is placing too many ads on their site, which can make the site look cluttered and spammy. Another mistake is not optimizing their ads, which can result in lower click-through rates and earnings. It's also important to avoid clicking on your own ads or encouraging others to do so, as this is against Google's policies and can result in your account being suspended.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>Google AdSense is a great way to earn passive income online. By following the steps in this article and optimizing your ads, you can start earning money from your website.
