It’s a great way to connect with your audience and build your brand. But can you make money from it? The answer is yes. In this article, we’ll explore how much you can make from TikTok Live and how to get started.</p><h2>How Does TikTok Live Work?</h2><p>TikTok Live is a feature that allows users to stream live videos to their followers. To use TikTok Live, you need to have at least 1,000 followers and be over 16 years old. Once you meet these requirements, you can start a live stream by tapping the plus sign at the bottom of the screen and selecting “Live”.</p><p>During your live stream, your followers can interact with you by commenting, sending virtual gifts, and requesting to join your stream.
