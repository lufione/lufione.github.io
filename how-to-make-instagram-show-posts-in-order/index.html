If you're tired of missing out on posts from your favorite accounts, there are some steps you can take to make Instagram show posts in order. Here's how:</p><h2>Step 1: Turn off the "Most Relevant" Algorithm</h2><p>By default, Instagram shows posts in order of "most relevant," which means that the algorithm decides which posts to show you based on your behavior on the app. However, you can turn this feature off and see posts in chronological order instead. To do this, go to your profile, tap the three lines in the top right corner, and select "Settings." From there, select "Account," then "Posts You've Liked," and toggle off "Show Posts You've Liked."</p><h2>Step 2: Use the "Following" Tab</h2><p>The "Following" tab is a feature that allows you to see posts from the accounts you follow in chronological order. To access this tab, go to your profile, tap the three lines in the top right corner, and select "Following." From there, you can see all the accounts you follow and their most recent posts.</p><h2>Step 3: Create Lists</h2><p>Creating lists is another way to see posts in chronological order. You can create a list of your favorite accounts and see their most recent posts without having to scroll through your entire feed. To create a list, go to your profile, tap the three lines in the top right corner, and select "Lists." From there, you can create a new list and add accounts to it.</p><h2>Step 4: Turn on Post Notifications</h2><p>If there are specific accounts whose posts you don't want to miss, you can turn on post notifications for them. To do this, go to their profile, tap the three dots in the top right corner, and select "Turn on Post Notifications." This will ensure that you receive a notification every time they post something new.</p><h2>Step 5: Engage with Posts</h2><p>The more you engage with posts on Instagram, the more likely the algorithm is to show you similar content. If you want to see posts in chronological order, make sure to engage with posts as soon as you see them. This can include liking, commenting, or saving the post.</p><h2>Step 6: Use Third-Party Apps</h2><p>There are several third-party apps available that can help you see posts in chronological order. These apps work by bypassing Instagram's algorithm and showing you content in the order it was posted. However, it's important to be cautious when using third-party apps, as they can pose security risks and violate Instagram's terms of service.</p><h2>Step 7: Optimize Your Instagram Strategy</h2><p>If you're a business or content creator, it's important to optimize your Instagram strategy to ensure that your posts are being seen by your followers. This can include posting at peak times, using hashtags, and engaging with your audience. By optimizing your strategy, you can increase the likelihood that your posts will appear in your followers' feeds.</p><h2>Step 8: Be Patient</h2><p>It's important to remember that Instagram's algorithm is constantly evolving, and it may take time for your feed to show posts in the order you prefer. Be patient and continue to engage with posts and optimize your strategy, and eventually, you should see a difference in the content that appears in your feed.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>If you're tired of missing out on posts from your favorite accounts, there are several steps you can take to make Instagram show posts in order. From turning off the "most relevant" algorithm to using third-party apps, there are several ways to ensure that you're seeing the content you want to see. By optimizing your Instagram strategy and engaging with posts, you can increase the likelihood that your content will be seen by your followers.</p></article>
