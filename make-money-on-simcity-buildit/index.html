Keep an eye on the demand for goods and services in your city to know which types of businesses to build.</p><h2>6. Connect with Friends</h2><p>Connecting with friends in the game can offer benefits like receiving gifts or borrowing items. Make sure to connect with other players to take advantage of these benefits and save some money.</p><h2>7. Save and Invest</h2><p>It's important to save your money and invest in your city wisely. Don't spend money on unnecessary items or upgrades. Instead, focus on building a sustainable and profitable city that will generate income in the long run.</p><h2>8. Use Specializations</h2><p>Specializations like education, transportation, and entertainment can offer bonuses to your city's income. Make sure to build and upgrade these specializations to take advantage of their benefits.</p><h2>9. Watch Ads for Rewards</h2><p>SimCity BuildIt offers rewards for watching ads in the game. These rewards can include cash, items, or even premium currency. Make sure to take advantage of this feature to earn some extra money.</p><h2>10. Don't Give Up</h2><p>Making money in SimCity BuildIt takes time and patience. Don't give up if you're not seeing results right away.
