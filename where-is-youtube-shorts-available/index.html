The feature was launched in 2020 and has been steadily gaining popularity ever since. In this article, we will explore where YouTube Shorts is available and how you can use it to grow your audience.</p><h2>What are YouTube Shorts?</h2><p>YouTube Shorts are vertical videos that are up to 60 seconds long. They can be created using the Shorts camera in the YouTube app or by uploading a video that is already in your camera roll.

However, it is important to note that not all features may be available in every country. YouTube is continuously expanding its availability, so it is important to check if it is available in your country.</p><h3>How to Check if YouTube Shorts is Available in Your Country</h3><p>To check if YouTube Shorts is available in your country, you can simply download the YouTube app and look for the Shorts camera icon at the bottom of the screen. If the icon is there, that means that Shorts is available in your country. If not, you may need to wait until it becomes available or use a VPN to access it from another country.</p><h2>How to Use YouTube Shorts</h2><p>Using YouTube Shorts is easy. Once you have confirmed that it is available in your country, you can start creating your own Shorts. To do this, simply open the YouTube app and tap on the Shorts camera icon.

YouTube has a library of free-to-use music that you can use in your Shorts, or you can purchase the rights to use copyrighted music through platforms like Epidemic Sound or Audiojungle.</p><h3>Can I Edit My Shorts After Uploading Them?</h3><p>Yes, you can edit your Shorts after uploading them. To do this, simply go to the video on your channel and click on the edit button.
