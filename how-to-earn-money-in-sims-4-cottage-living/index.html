In this new pack, players get to experience life in a quaint village, surrounded by nature and farm animals. One of the main objectives in the game is to earn money, which can be used to upgrade your cottage, buy new furniture, and more. In this article, we'll give you some tips on how to earn money in Sims 4 Cottage Living.</p><h2>1. Sell Your Produce</h2><p>One of the easiest ways to make money in this game is by selling the produce that you grow in your garden. You can grow fruits, vegetables, and even flowers, which can be sold at the local farmer's market or to other Sims in the village. Make sure to tend to your garden regularly to ensure a steady supply of produce.</p><h2>2. Raise Livestock</h2><p>Another way to make money is by raising livestock. You can purchase chickens, cows, and llamas, which will produce eggs, milk, and wool respectively. You can sell these items for a profit, or use them to make other products like cheese, butter, and clothing.</p><h2>3. Complete Jobs</h2><p>The village is full of job opportunities, which can help you earn some extra cash. You can work as a farmer, baker, or even a courier. Make sure to check the job board regularly to see what jobs are available, and complete them to earn money and gain experience.</p><h2>4. Participate in Festivals</h2><p>The village hosts several festivals throughout the year, which can be a great opportunity to earn money. You can participate in events like the bake-off, the flower competition, and the llama race, which offer cash prizes to the winners.</p><h2>5. Sell Your Crafts</h2><p>If you're skilled in crafting, you can sell your creations to other Sims in the village. You can make candles, pottery, and even knitwear, which can fetch a good price. You can also sell your crafts online, using the Simstagram app.</p><h2>6. Complete Aspirations</h2><p>Completing aspirations is a great way to earn money and gain satisfaction points. As you complete tasks related to your aspiration, you'll earn rewards like money, new items, and even special traits.</p><h2>7. Host a Yard Sale</h2><p>If you have a lot of unwanted items in your inventory, you can host a yard sale to get rid of them. Other Sims in the village will come to your yard sale and purchase your items for a discounted price.</p><h2>8. Fish for Profit</h2><p>You can also make money by fishing in the village's pond or river. You can catch different types of fish, which can be sold for a profit. You can also use the fish to make meals, which can be sold or consumed by your Sim.</p><h2>9. Upgrade Your Cottage</h2><p>Upgrading your cottage can increase its value, which can be beneficial if you decide to sell it later on. You can upgrade your cottage by adding new furniture, decorations, and even new rooms. Make sure to save up some money before embarking on a renovation project.</p><h2>10. Invest in Your Skills</h2><p>Investing in your skills can help you earn more money in the long run. You can improve your gardening, cooking, and crafting skills, which will allow you to produce higher quality items that can be sold for more money. You can also invest in your Sim's career, which can lead to higher pay and better job opportunities.</p></main></body></html></article>
